## **Executive Summary**

**🌍 Vision**: Cultivating heritage crops and reclaiming food sovereignty for Canada’s African & Caribbean diaspora. By growing cultural greens  locally, we reduce reliance on imports and restore fresh, culturally meaningful produce to communities in the GTA and across Ontario.

**Why it matters:** Food sovereignty centers People’s rights to culturally appropriate food, produced sustainably and locally With Canada’s Black population at 1.5 million (4.3 % of national popn, over 770,000 in Ontario, largely concentrated in GTA)  [Statistics Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/daily-quotidien/241025/dq241025b-eng.htm?utm_source=chatgpt.com), access to heritage foods is limited by cold‑chain imports and lack of local supply.

**💡 Unique Value**: Ontario’s **first Black-led farm** to focus on **year-round West African and Caribbean greens** using **sustainable greenhouse, hydroponic, and pasture systems**.

**Our impact:**

- Empower Ontario’s African & Caribbean communities with fresh, culturally meaningful produce
