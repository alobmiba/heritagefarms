};
```

## üîÑ Complete User Journey

### **Step 1: Customer Browsing**
```typescript
// User visits /products/leafy-greens
1. Next.js calls ProductService.getEnrichedProducts()
2. Fetches from Strapi: All leafy green products with content
3. Fetches from Firebase: Current pricing and inventory for each SKU
4. Merges data and shows:
   - Callaloo: $4.99/bunch (25 in stock) ‚úÖ Available
   - Ugu: $6.99/bunch (0 in stock) ‚ùå Out of Stock
```

### **Step 2: Product Detail View**
```typescript
// User clicks on Callaloo
1. Route: /products/callaloo (or /products/CAL001)
2. ProductService.getEnrichedProduct("CAL001")
3. Display combined information:
   - Rich content from Strapi (description, benefits, images)
   - Real-time data from Firebase (price, availability)
   - "Add to Cart" button (enabled because inStock: true)
```

### **Step 3: Add to Cart**
```typescript
// User clicks "Add to Cart"
const cartItem = {
  sku: "CAL001",
  name: "Callaloo",
  localName: "Caribbean Spinach",
  price: 4.99,
  priceUnit: "bunch",
  quantity: 2,
  image: "/uploads/callaloo-fresh.jpg",
  subtotal: 9.98
};

// Store in React Context + localStorage
addToCart(cartItem);
```

### **Step 4: Checkout Process**
```typescript
// User proceeds to checkout
1. Validate cart items against current inventory
   - Check if CAL001 still has stock >= 2
   - Verify price hasn't changed since adding to cart
   
2. If validation passes, show checkout form
3. User enters shipping/payment information
```

### **Step 5: Order Creation**
```typescript
// User submits order
const order = {
  id: "ORD_001_20240121",
  customerId: null, // Guest order
  items: [
    {
      sku: "CAL001",
      quantity: 2,
      unitPrice: 4.99,
      subtotal: 9.98
    }
  ],
  totalAmount: 14.97, // Including shipping
  status: "pending",
  customerInfo: {
    name: "John Smith",
    email: "john@example.com",
    phone: "+1-555-0123"
  },
  shippingAddress: {...},

  shippingCost: 4.99,

  paymentStatus: "pending",
  createdAt: "2024-01-21T15:45:00Z"
};

// Save to Firebase
await firebaseService.createOrder(order);
```

### **Step 6: Inventory Update**
```typescript
// Automatically deduct inventory
await firebaseService.updateInventory("CAL001", {
  stockQuantity: 25 - 2, // Now 23
  updatedAt: new Date()
});

// Real-time update on website
// Next customer sees "23 in stock"
```
