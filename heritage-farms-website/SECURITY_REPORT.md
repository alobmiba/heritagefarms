# Security Review Report - Heritage Farms Website

**Date:** December 16, 2025  
**Reviewer:** Security Analysis Tool  
**Project:** Heritage Farms Website (Next.js E-commerce Application)

## Executive Summary

The security review has identified several areas of concern and recommendations for the Heritage Farms website. While the application implements some security best practices, there are critical vulnerabilities that need immediate attention.

## ðŸ”´ Critical Issues

### 1. Console Logging of Sensitive Information
**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Location:** Multiple files including authentication handlers (`src/app/api/auth/[...nextauth]/route.ts:30-61`, `src/middleware.ts:18-36`)  
**Issue:** Authentication details and admin access information are being logged to console  
**Recommendation:** Remove all console.log statements that expose user emails, admin status, and authentication tokens in production

### 2. Missing Content Security Policy (CSP)
**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Issue:** No comprehensive CSP header is configured for the application  
**Recommendation:** Implement a strict CSP policy to prevent XSS attacks. Add to `next.config.ts`:
```javascript
headers: [
  {
    key: 'Content-Security-Policy',
    value: "default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline';"
  }
]
```

### 3. Unsafe HTML Rendering
**Risk Level:** HIGH  
**Location:** `src/app/blog/[id]/page.tsx:194`, `src/app/layout.tsx:120,134,162,215`  
**Issue:** Use of `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without content sanitization  
**Recommendation:** Implement HTML sanitization using libraries like DOMPurify before rendering user-generated content

## ðŸŸ¡ Medium Priority Issues

### 4. Weak Firebase Security Rules
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** `firestore.rules:11-14`, `storage.rules:5-9`  
**Issues:**
- Orders can be created by any authenticated user without validation
- Storage allows write access to any authenticated user
- No rate limiting on Firebase operations
**Recommendations:**
- Implement stricter validation rules for order creation
- Add file type and size restrictions for storage uploads
- Implement per-user rate limiting in Firebase rules

### 5. Environment Variable Exposure
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** `next.config.ts:178`  
**Issue:** Custom environment variables are exposed to the client bundle  
**Recommendation:** Only expose necessary public variables prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`

### 6. Missing CSRF Protection
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Issue:** No CSRF token validation in API routes  
**Recommendation:** Implement CSRF protection for all state-changing operations using NextAuth's built-in CSRF protection or a dedicated library

### 7. Insufficient Input Validation
**Risk Level:** MEDIUM  
**Location:** `src/app/api/orders/route.ts`  
**Issues:**
- Email/phone regex validation is basic
- No sanitization of user input before database storage
- Price parsing from string is vulnerable to manipulation (`line 161`)
**Recommendations:**
- Use robust validation libraries like Zod throughout
- Sanitize all user inputs before storage
- Store prices as integers (cents) from the start

## ðŸŸ¢ Low Priority Issues

### 8. Security Headers Could Be Improved
**Risk Level:** LOW  
**Current Implementation:** Basic security headers are present  
**Recommendations:**
- Add `Strict-Transport-Security` header for HTTPS enforcement
- Add `Permissions-Policy` to control browser features
- Consider adding `X-Permitted-Cross-Domain-Policies`

### 9. Rate Limiting Implementation
**Risk Level:** LOW  
**Current:** Rate limiting is implemented using Redis/Vercel KV  
**Recommendations:**
- Current implementation (10 requests/60s) might be too restrictive for legitimate users
- Consider implementing different rate limits for different endpoints
- Add rate limiting to authentication endpoints

### 10. Admin Access Control
**Risk Level:** LOW  
**Current:** Email-based admin access control  
**Recommendations:**
- Consider implementing role-based access control (RBAC)
- Add audit logging for all admin actions
- Implement session timeout for admin users

## âœ… Positive Security Measures

1. **No Dependency Vulnerabilities:** npm audit shows 0 vulnerabilities
2. **Authentication:** NextAuth implementation with Google OAuth
3. **Rate Limiting:** Implemented on order submission endpoint
4. **Security Monitoring:** Basic security monitoring utility exists (`src/lib/security-monitor.ts`)
5. **Input Validation:** Zod schema validation for orders
6. **HTTPS Headers:** X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options configured

## ðŸ“‹ Immediate Action Items

1. **Remove all console.log statements** containing sensitive information
2. **Implement Content Security Policy** headers
3. **Sanitize HTML content** before using dangerouslySetInnerHTML
4. **Strengthen Firebase security rules** with proper validation
5. **Add CSRF protection** to all API routes

## ðŸ“Š Security Score

**Overall Security Rating: 6.5/10**

- Authentication & Authorization: 7/10
- Data Protection: 6/10
- Input Validation: 6/10
- Security Headers: 7/10
- Dependency Management: 10/10
- Logging & Monitoring: 5/10

## Recommendations Priority Matrix

| Priority | Issue | Effort | Impact |
|----------|-------|--------|--------|
| 1 | Remove console.logs | Low | High |
| 2 | Implement CSP | Medium | High |
| 3 | HTML Sanitization | Medium | High |
| 4 | Firebase Rules | Medium | Medium |
| 5 | CSRF Protection | High | Medium |
| 6 | Enhanced Validation | Medium | Medium |
| 7 | Security Headers | Low | Low |
| 8 | RBAC Implementation | High | Low |

## Conclusion

The Heritage Farms website has a solid foundation but requires immediate attention to critical security issues, particularly around information disclosure through console logging and content security. Implementing the recommended fixes will significantly improve the application's security posture.

## Next Steps

1. Create a remediation plan addressing critical issues first
2. Implement security fixes in a development environment
3. Conduct penetration testing after fixes
4. Establish regular security audits
5. Implement automated security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
